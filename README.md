# Hybrid-Combination-of-SJF-and-Round-Robin
The hybrid scheduling algorithm combines the Round Robin (RR) and Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling techniques to optimize process scheduling in operating systems. This algorithm aims to strike a balance between fairness and efficiency by considering the burst time of processes.
